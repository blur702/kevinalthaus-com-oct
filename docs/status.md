# Implementation Status

## Completed

- Auth endpoints and middleware (login/register/refresh/logout, me)
- Database layer and migrations (users, refresh_tokens, plugin_registry, system_settings, audit_log, plugin_kv_store)
- API Gateway auth and security (JWT verification, user context headers, rate limits, CORS, Helmet)
- User CRUD with RBAC and validation
- Health endpoints (health/live/ready) across services
- Security headers with environment toggles
- Environment-based CORS across services
- Standardized port configuration (API 3000, Main 3001)
- Automated PostgreSQL backups and retention policy
- Refresh token storage (hashed) and rotation
- Structured logging utilities in shared package

## Partial

- Route-specific rate limiting: general/auth done; plugin/upload routes need stricter policies and headers

## Pending

- Plugin runtime & registry REST APIs (upload, manifest validation, sandboxing, lifecycle transitions)
- File upload system (multer, MIME validation, sanitization)
- Input sanitization coverage across all routes
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- Admin dashboard integration with real APIs and route guards
- Admin auth UI (login/signup/reset) and protected routes
- Plugin quotas & storage enforcement utilities
